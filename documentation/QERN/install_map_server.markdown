#Setup Map Server

Install Map Server and PHP Map Script

    sudo yum install mapserver php-mapserver

> Note: Enterprise Linux GIS (ELGIS) are responsible for maintaining the CentOS GIS packages for map server. At the time of writing this section (20th Sept, 2012), they are experiencing technical difficulties with their servers. They expect this issue to be resolved within several days. I will finish this section once the packages are available again. Updates regarding the ELGIS issues are available here: https://twitter.com/EnterpriseLxGIS
