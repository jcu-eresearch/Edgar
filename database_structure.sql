-- The classification enum has these values, in order:
--     "unknown" - lolwut i don't even
--     "invalid" - nope, you didn't see the bird here
--     "historic" - bird was there when you saw it in 1960, but they don't live there now
--     "vagrant" - bird might have been seen there, bit it doesn't actually live there/can't survive there
--     "irruptive" - bird sometimes lives there, like when there's a mouse plague or something, but it's not a persistent habitat
--     "core" - bird lives there, some or all of the year. may or may not breed there.
--     "introduced" - like "core", but it was introduced to the habitat by humans
--
-- The occurrence should be used in modelling if the vetting's classification is "core", "introduced" or "unknown".
